# .Qowaiv v7.0.0
## A release with breaking changes
It has been a while (two and a half years ago) since a new major release has
been published. For multiple reasons, introducing breaking changes is bad,
but for a package like Qowaiv it is even worse than for most packages:
once you start using them, you'll end up having the dependency everywhere.
(Which is a good thing, I would argue.)

Because of this, also for this release, breaking changes are kept to a
minimum, and grouped together, although the last makes that releasing new
majors still can become challenging.

So, most most breaking changes is about code being dropped, becuase is has been
considdered a bad practice and due to that, being marked as obsolete for a long
time.

In `Clock` there has been one change that gave me some headache, but I decided
to go forward with after all: `Qowaiv.Now()` returns a `DateTimeOffset` instead
of a `DateTime`, `Clock.NowWithOffset` has been dropped. In practice, you can
not longer get a `DateTime` back describing the local time as `DateTime`. Using
`Clock.Now()` was something I never liked due it's ambigous nature. By returning
a `DateTimeOffset` that has been fixed.

if not, please let me know. I might be able to help you out.
