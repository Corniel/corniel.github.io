# WTF (1)
Let me start by pointing out that VisualBasic is not my cup of tea. I don’t
like all those implicit castings. Like this:

``` vb.NET
Function DecimalSeparator() As String
DecimalSeparator = (1 / 2).ToString.Substring(1, 1)
End Function
```

The .Net way of doing things is of course:

``` vb.NET
Function DecimalSeparator() As String
Return System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.NumberFormat.NumberDecimalSeparator
End Function
```

But I guess that was too much for this programmer.
