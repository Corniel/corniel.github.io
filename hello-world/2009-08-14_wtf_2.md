# WTF (2)
While reviewing some code for a project of our company I found this:

``` C#
public override void Redirect(PipelineContext pipelineContext)
{
	string linkcp = "";
	if (linkcp == null || linkcp == "" || linkcp.Length == 0)
		linkcp = “default.aspx”;

	pipelineContext.Response.Redirect(linkcp);
}
```

It first drew my attention because of the if-statement (testing a string being
not `null` or `string.Empty` three times) and its missing brackets. But it
surprised – well, shocked – me because the variable that was assigned, and
validated afterwards directly. The writer of this piece of WTF declared that it
was generated, and needed some custom implementation…

I could not help, but think why not – in that case – do it this way:

``` C#
public override void Redirect(PipelineContext pipelineContext)
{
    string linkcp = string.Empty;
    // TODO: implement logic.
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(linkcp))
    {
        linkcp = "~/default.aspx";
    }
    pipelineContext.Response.Redirect(linkcp);
}
```

or, if should fail while not implemented yet

``` C#
    public override void Redirect(PipelineContext pipelineContext)
    {
    public override void Redirect(PipelineContext pipelineContext)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException(“TODO: implement logic.”);
        //string linkcp = string.Empty;
        //if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(linkcp))
        //{
        //    linkcp = “~/default.aspx”;
        //}
        //pipelineContext.Response.Redirect(linkcp);
    }
}
```

What is it about writing comments that my fellow developers seems to dislike
 that much? It would make reading and understanding code so much easier...
