# A tribute to two women who enabled my career

## My great-grandmother
My great-grandmother (the mother of the mother of my mother) is without any
doubt someone who inspired my career, even if she did not live to see the result.

Born in april 1895, she was the only relative I ever knew who was born in the
19th century. She was the youngest of thirteen children who became a kindergarden
teacher until she married (she was fired as result, which was law back in the
day in the Netherlands, and not only there). 

Her husband died when she was just 32 years old, mother of 3 daughters, in the
age of 5 (my grandmother), 3, and 1 year old. She rebranded the store she and
her husband owned, from furniture to yarn (as no men in these days would
buy furniture from a woman, or take her advice on the subject).

She sent all her daughters to the [MULO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meer_Uitgebreid_Lager_Onderwijs)
(a form of extended primary education). This was definitively frowned up by some,
as it was not considered useful for women to get educated beyond the bare
minimum in the 30's of the previous century. She did it anyway because she
strongly believed that education was the only way to become financially
independent.

That mindset shaped both my grandmother and mother and were also key to how
I was raised, and now raise my daughter. The fact that my great-grandmother
lived another sixty years as a widow, was around when Women's suffrage was
granted in the Netherlands in 1917 and survived two world wars, also trigged my
interest in history. She died when I was just 8 years old, but I already understood
how special she was.

## Ellen Post
The key figure in my education, the one who saved me from failing at school is
my remedial teacher Ellen Post. I'm still in her debt 30 years later.

I was not an easy going kid. I was (still am) hot-tempered, easily distracted,
and hyperly active. As a result, my schoolresults were not that great,
although I had (fairly) good results for arithmetics and maths. My behavior was
really problematic at times, to the extend that I even was expelled temporary
from school once.

But Ellen believed in me. When some colleagues proposed to expel me permanently,
she used her influence to convince them not only to let me stay, but also
to let me pass the fourth grade. On top of that she arranged that I could follow
an extra subject, required to go to university. Without her, that would not
have happened.

She helped me believe in myself, something I did not do at the time. 
 
If it wasn't for her, I would never have been able to go to university, a life
changing event, which without I most likely never would have become a software
engineer. Thank you again.

I think the world is a better place due to the existance of these extraordinary
women, who I was lukcy to know.
