# dot Ned { Saturday }
## Single Value Objects

It has been a while since I had my last real life talk during a congress (a meetup you co-host does not count, I would argue),
but finally I've got the opportunity again to do so during [dot Ned { Saturday }](https://dotnedsaturday.nl).
I submitted three talks, and they went for **Single Value Objects: where DDD and Functional Programming share forces**.

Although I have given this talk multiple times (in many forms), I was pretty nervous (as I always am) upfront.
Specially because I really care for this topic, and despite my enthusiasm and evangelizing, so far, I don't feel the topic has got the traction it deserves.
It keeps me wondering, am I just not good in advocating for its cause, or am I blind for the objections and is it - after all - just a bad idea.

The unique selling point of *dot Ned* is the Dutch language (although I wasn't aware of that upfront), so I found out that my talk should be in Dutch too.
As a native speaker that in it self was not difficult, but I felt a bit off, with some slides with English quotes. (Both me, and my audience survived).

Anyway, I tried to speak as slow as I could which made me deliver my talk in just over 40 minutes (out of the available 60).
Happy to say, the audience seemed enthusiastic, and the remaining 20 minutes where easily spend on questions.

The day after, I think it is safe to say that it is easier to deliver a message in your mother tongue.
That being said, I'm also under the strong impression that DDD is getting (a lot of) traction, and that as a result, Single Value Objects get that too.
And maybe, just maybe, that would mean that [Qowaiv](https://github.com/Qowaiv/Qowaiv) finally (after 8 years) gets some traction.
