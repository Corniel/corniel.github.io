# Enforce project dependencies
Lately, Iâ€™ve had some discussions with colleagues about project dependencies.
Long version short: they were not aware about the reasoning, and therefore
violated the original intend. Some of them countered with: but, where is the
documentation?

A fair point.

For our project, we now have a reply: it is in the specs! And if you violate
them, assertions will fail. And more over, you can read why those changes
were not a good idea.

Thanks to [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/), it is easy to
write these specs. Feel inspired!

``` C#
internal static readonly Assembly API = typeof(MyProject.Api.ApiAction).Assembly;
internal static readonly Assembly Domain = typeof(MyProject.Domain.Aanvrager).Assembly;
internal static readonly Assembly Application = typeof(MyProject.Application.ApplicationDefaults).Assembly;
internal static readonly Assembly Infrastructure = typeof(MyProject.Infrastructure.MongoDbConfig).Assembly;
internal static readonly Assembly Shared = typeof(Abn.Shared.DateExtensions).Assembly;
internal static readonly Assembly MongoDbEventStorage = typeof(MongoDbEventStorage.CollectionNames).Assembly;

    => API.Should()

    .Reference(Application, because: "it exposes the Application via controller methods").And
    .Reference(Infrastructure, because: "it requires the infrastructure for its implementations of Domain and Application interfaces");
